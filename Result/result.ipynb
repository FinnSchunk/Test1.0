    "How to Document Python Code?\n",
    "----------------------------\n",

    "What is a Unit Test?\n",
    "--------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a **Unit Test** is a Python function that checks whether\n",
    "another function does exactly what it is meant to do. A function, in\n",
    "this sense, is a “unit of code”, hence the name, “unit test.”\n",
    "\n",
    "By the way, unit tests are available to all programming languages, not\n",
    "only in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why are Unit Tests useful? Because they can be executed over and over\n",
    "again by a computer, and if they fail, we can be alerted automatically.\n",
    "This means that we can be sure that our software behaves the way it is\n",
    "intended to behave **at all times.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Some projects have tens, hundreds, and sometimes even **thousands** of\n",
    "automated tests running every hour. This makes sure that nobody adds a\n",
    "bug to the existing codebase when they modify a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a rule of thumb, the more unit tests your project has, the better.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unit Test Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a (quite trivial) function that adds two numbers and returns the\n",
    "result. Click on the code block below, and remove the comment in front\n",
    "of the call to the `add()` function with the parameters 45 and 63. The\n",
    "result, as expected, should be 108.\n",
    "\n",
    "To execute the code, just click on it, remove the comment, and hit\n",
    "`CONTROL + ENTER` in your keyboard. That will execute the code and show\n",
